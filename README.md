# 🌍 Terraform Practice Projects – Azure & AWS

This repository contains a curated set of Terraform projects developed to explore **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** across **Microsoft Azure** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. All resources are provisioned using free-tier offerings from both vendors to ensure accessibility and cost efficiency.

## 🚀 Goals

- Reinforce hands-on experience with Terraform modules, providers, and resource lifecycle.
- Apply **cloud-native security**, **modular design**, and **cost optimization** strategies.
- Demonstrate how to deploy scalable infrastructure on Azure and AWS using **only free-tier resources**.
- Build reusable Terraform templates for future production-grade designs.


## 🧱 Key Concepts Practiced

- **Modular Terraform design**
- **SSM Agent-based access** to EC2 (no public IPs)
- **VPC/Subnet segmentation**, NAT instance setup
- **Cloud resource tagging and lifecycle policies**
- **Security best practices** (IAM roles, least privilege)
- Cost-aware provisioning using **Free Tier eligibility**
- **State management and remote backend planning**

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Terraform
- AWS Free Tier (EC2, RDS, VPC, S3, IAM, etc.)
- Azure Free Tier (VMs, Storage Account, VNets)
- Visual Studio Code + Terraform extensions

## 🔐 Notes

> All projects avoid commercial resource charges by leveraging **free-tier limits**, while maintaining **secure** and **scalable architecture patterns**. These samples are educational and **not intended for production use without additional enhancements**.
